# MNIST Digit Generator with Conditional VAE

This repository contains a **Streamlit web application** that generates handwritten digit images (0-9) using a **Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)** trained from scratch on the MNIST dataset.

**Try it out live at:** [MNIST Digit Generator](https://digit-to-handwritten-images-4epbvaljwvyqrkeaczgyam.streamlit.app/)

---

## Features

- Select a digit (0â€“9) via a slider.
- Generate 5 diverse handwritten digit images of the selected digit.
- Images are generated by a custom-trained CVAE model (no pre-trained weights used).
- Simple and clean web interface using Streamlit.
- Model trained using PyTorch.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- GPU recommended for training (optional for running the app)
- Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the App Locally

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shadabtanjeed/Digit-to-handwritten-images
cd mnist-digit-generator
```

2. Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

3. Open your browser at `http://localhost:8501` to use the app.

## Model Training

- The CVAE model was trained from scratch on the MNIST dataset (28x28 grayscale).
- Training script included in the repository (if applicable).
- Model saved as `cvae_mnist.pth`.
- No pre-trained weights were used.
